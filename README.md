# Prerequisites:

AIO installed on client and server

# Installation:
1. Put contents of "Scripts" in the Lua scripts directory on the server
2. Run contents of "SQL" in MySQL in a the world database.

You can access the store through the logging in or spell the command !rewards / !rw (for short)

# What it does?
It is a simply system that let you give the player rewards for every 24 hours or for every 7 days (Time is saved by the button click)
this script is still pretty simple and can may handle some improvements but I want to share it now either way since I could even require some more help with what I want to go for it
You can add in the database for weekly or daily the items for yourself its dynamic and the player will recieve the items through mail!
The system is build that the player cannot abuse by crashing the server of if you reload the scripts everything with the time is saved in the db and with the playerGUID
I hope you like it :)
